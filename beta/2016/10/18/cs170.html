      <h2> Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm </h2>

<p>The Ford-Fulkerson method is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a given network. It is often called a <em>“method”</em> because the exact approach to selecting augmenting paths isn’t well defined (a definition we’ll see later in the <em>Edmonds-Karp</em> algorithm).</p>

<h3> Main Idea </h3>

<p>Consider a graph in which we’re attempting to find the max-flow from start vertex $s$ to end vertex $t$; As long as there is a path from the source node $t$, we send flow along one of the paths, of size of the smallest capacity on the path (leaving a residual network). Continuing to do so until no path exists, leaves only the maximum flow on the graph.</p>

<h3> The Code </h3>

<pre> <code>
def FFFlow(graph,s,t):
	f[edge] = 0 forall edges
	while existsPositivePath(s,t):
		path = getPositivePath(graph,s,t)
		minFlow = min(capacity of path)
		for edge in path:
			f[edge] += minFlow
			graph.capacity[edge] -= minFlow
	return f
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we have that <em>getPositivePath</em> returns a path (if one exists) in the graph, such that the minimum capacity is greater than 0.</p>

<p>The general gist is that at every iteration, we pick a path with positive flow and append it to our current flow.</p>

<h3> Runtime Analysis </h3>

<h3> Proof of Correctness </h3>

<h2> Edmonds-Karp Algorithm </h2>

<p>Pick the $s-t$ path in the newtork with the fewest edges (using BFS)</p>

<p>The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an extension of the Ford-Fulkerson method for calculating the maximum flow in a network in time $O(VE^2)$</p>

<h3> Analysis </h3>

<p>We will show that the number of iterations required for this to converge is <span>​<script type="math/tex">\leq EV</script></span>. We do show by showing that the distance (number of edges) of t from s in residual network increases at least every $E$ iterations.</p>

<p>Before doing so, we consider a Linear Program which models Maximum Flow (this is a very bad linear program in practice, but it provides insight into the process)</p>

<p>Let <strong>P</strong> be the set of all paths that go from $s$ to $t$. Recall that we can formulate the max-flow problem as maximizing the sum of flow that goes through each path (assuming each is distinct).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\max \sum_{p} f_p</script>

<p>Constrained by <script type="math/tex">\forall e \in E \sum_{p \in P ~s.t.~~ e \in p} f_p \leq c_e</script></p>

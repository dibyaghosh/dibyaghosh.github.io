One-on-One OH Signup (2/22): [https://doodle.com/poll/7dmwttcih35z756t](https://doodle.com/poll/7dmwttcih35z756t)

These OH are not for curriculum questions ("How do you solve this HW/Lab/RevSet problem...") - please use Piazza or regular office hours for that.

If space is full, and you want to sign up, shoot me an email at dibya@berkeley.edu

If the time doesn't work for you, reach out to me, and I'll see if I can set up some alternate slots, or meet personally at a different time.

Of course, you can always reach out to me via email.

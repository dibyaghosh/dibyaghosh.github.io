## A Reminiscence

I'm writing this post as the final hours of 2017 tick away. It's a very stressful time for my family right now: my brother is racing to finish his college applications as I type. It feels like I applied eons ago: how time flies, huh?

2017 has been a pretty crazy year for me, mentally at least. I definitely feel like I'm coming out a different person than I entered. Here are some highlights:

- I'm a more *laidback* person now, which can be a good and bad thing. I stress less about the small tasks, but I've found my apathy damaging to my taste for excellence. 
-  I'm a more *confident* person now: I have Andy and Mrs. Artois to thank for that. This hasn't helped my social (and dating) life very much though; here's to that changing next year.
- I have a much stronger *sense of purpose* as to what I want to pursue intellectually. Doing research in Sergey's lab has drastically shaped this.

## An Introspection

I have a highly addictive personality: it drives me to obsession too quick. I don't think that this'll change, but I have an idea to counter it. I didn't approach 2017 with a *creed*, a life purpose,which meant I was too easily influenced, and moven off track. In this document, I hope to establish a creed: it may change, bit by bit, or even drastically, but it needs to start somewhere.

I have very poor self-discipline and drive, and I'm very streaky. Whenever I start a goal, it starts off well the first week, but then immediately devolves. The furthest I got was during the summer, when I cut my weight to 153 lbs. But this habit went to shit this semester, with my poor eating habits. This definitely needs to change. I'm also a lazy fuck: this needs to change as well.

## Quotes I Try To Live By

**Invictus** by William Henley

    It matters not how strait the gate, 
    How charged with punishments the scroll, 
    I am the master of my fate: 
    I am the captain of my soul.

**The Invitation** by Oriah Mountain Dreamer

    I want to know 
    if you will risk 
    looking like a fool
    for love
    for your dream
    for the adventure of being alive.

**The Road Not Taken** by Robert Frost 

    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference

**Have You Earned Your Tomorrow** - Anonymous

    Is anybody happier because you passed his way?
    Does anyone remember that you spoke to him today?
    This day is almost over, and its toiling time is through;
    Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you?

    Did you give a cheerful greeting to the friend who came along? 
    Or a churlish sort of "Howdy" and then vanish in the throng? 
    Were you selfish pure and simple as you rushed along the way, 
    Or is someone mighty grateful for a deed you did today?

    Can you say tonight, in parting with the day that's slipping fast,
    That you helped a single brother of the many that you passed?
    Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said;
    Does a man whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead?

    Did you waste the day, or lose it, was it well or sorely spent?
    Did you leave a trail of kindness or a scar of discontent?
    As you close your eyes in slumber do you think that God would say,
    You have earned one more tomorrow by the work you did today?

## Mind

### Meditate More
- Meditate once a day

### Cut the Computer

#### General Principles
- Spend as little time as possible on the computer (6 hrs a day)
- Don't be on the phone when I wake up and bedtime

## Health

### Get Rid of the Belly

### Establish a Morning Routine and Evening Routine

By establishing a system, I hope to counter my internal "lazy fuck", and take better care of my skin, hair, and teeth.


## Intelligence

### Increase Productivity

I spent minimal time on classes in Fall 2017, which allowed me to spend more time on research. Problem is, I didn't spend that time on research. I need to set up a system to be more productive this semester, so when I work, I actually get work done.
